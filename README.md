# Art of Learning a Programming Language

I believe, the art of learning a programming language is similar to any spoken language we learn through years from preschool to matriculation.

To begin with, just like we buy a slate, pencil, book and pen before learning anything in school

To begin with, just like we learn alphabets in intial classes of school; which is mostly a memory intensive task, we also need to put some memory in remembering different data types, keywords, concepts and methodologies employeed in a programming language. _**we are not allowed to put a pinch of creativity or previous skills when learning these concepts. These form as a basic building blocks of the language**_

while learning a language, after learning basic alphabets we start stitching these alphabets to create words and words are stitched to create sentences. The grammar of a language makes these sentences more meaningful and poetic manner.

Similarly we start writing programs or scripts by stitching the data types and keywords we learn in intial stage of learning. The syntax of the language will make the scripts understandable by the computer for execution.

So Everytime, while learning a language or any associated framework I invest 30% of time in building muscle memory about data types, keywords and syntax.
