    5.3 while loops
<br />
6. Working with functions
    6.1 Creating and calling a function
    6.2 How to specify default values of an argument to a function
    6.2 variable arguments, keyword arguments of a function
    6.3 pass by value and pass by reference, variable scoping.

    7.2 discuss about implicit exception python provides
    7.3 able to create new custom exception

8. Working with files:
    8.1 Read text files from filesystem
    8.2 use automation to read large files and cache data for processing

<br />

9. Advanced concepts:
    9.1 OOPs concepts like classes, special methods, 
    9.2 creating instances of these classes and using them
    9.3 decorators in python - as python is a functional programming language
    9.4 lambda expressions
 

 I encourage students to come up with any missing concepts they would like to understand as a part of course.
